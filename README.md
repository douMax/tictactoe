# Project[0]: TicTacToe

## smaller heading

My TicTacToe game is built using html, css and javascript.
You can try my live TicTacToe [here](https://doumax.github.io/tictactoe/)

## Features
- The game contains 2 sets of tokens: classical x/o and pictures(sun and moon);
- The token indicator tells which set of tokens are in use and assign tokens to the players
- The game has sessionStorage in use. You can close the tab or refresh the page during the game, all progress are saved. The previous game state will be restored when the page is loaded.


## Bugs
- When switch turns the players number will be highlighted, but visually not perfect.
- AI mode still under development.
